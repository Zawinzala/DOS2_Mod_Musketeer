## Musketeer Mod - Roadmap

### WIP Features

- Unload skill (Currently, first iteration has no Animation)

- Mark Target spells (Actually already mostly works!)
    - 2 different Statuses are employed:
        - Mark Target, simply a debuff that stays on the target for its duration
        - Mark Target Damage, (Uses different name) Status that is applied to cause damage. You check if "Mark Target" is true, and then apply "Mark Target Damage" to get deal damage once
        - Damage is based on the Mark Damage Weapon Stat.

- Spell: "Buckshot" (Already works, but the fire cone is only created when you actually hit a character)
    - Fire a shell on your target, exploding on impact and dealing damage to all targets behind it in a cone
        - Also creates a fire surface in said cone area. (Dragon Breath Cone style)
        
### New Features

- Reload drawback Implementation. Reloading should be a impactful decision you face in your turn. Reloading should basically cost you a turn.
    - Add "Reloading" as a debuff status that has a duration of 1 turn and is triggered upon casing "Reload".
        - You cannot cast spells while reloading.
        - You cannot attack while reloading.
        - This debuff can only be cleansed by death.
        - Your movement speed is reduced by 75% while reloading.
