/*

Notes for custom talents:

Core issue: tooltip requests for talents with an Id higher than 127 cause a crash

Intended solution: Intercept tooltip requests with a Id higher than 127 and run custom logic to handle them

Need to research:
- Possible to intercept tooltip requests with necessary info?
- Possible to return a working tooltip using custom logic to be shown in the Ui?

Notes:
- The AddTalent function is in stats_1.as file
